Hi there! I'm a data scientist on a mission to share my learning journey with the world. Throughout my career, I've had the opportunity to work on some fascinating projects that have challenged me to think creatively and push the boundaries of what's possible with data. I aim to share my experiences and insights with others who are just starting out in the field.
